# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This repository contains two versions of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. Both versions offer interactive gameplay, but they differ in their features, code structure, and enhancements.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Basic Tic-Tac-Toe

**Description:**
A command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players (or a player versus a basic AI) to compete on a board of customizable size. This version provides a fundamental implementation of the game logic.

**Key Features:**

*   Interactive game loop with input validation.
*   Option to play against a random-move AI.
*   Score tracking with JSON file storage.

**How to Run:**

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```
    pip install numpy colorama
    ```
2.  **Run the game:**

    ```
    python Tic_tac_toe_game.py
    ```

### 2. Enhanced Tic-Tac-Toe

**Description:**

An enhanced version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game with improved code structure, type hints, and detailed docstrings. This version builds upon the basic game by adding features that improve code readability and maintainability.

**Key Features:**

*   Interactive game loop with input validation.
*   Option to play against a random-move AI.
*   Score tracking with JSON file storage.
*   Enhanced code readability with type hints and modular structure.

**How to Run:**

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```
    pip install numpy colorama
    ```

2.  **Run the game:**

    ```
    python Tic_tac_toe_enhanced.py
    ```

## Differences Between the Projects

*   **Code Structure:**
    *   `Tic_tac_toe_game.py`:  A more basic implementation with less emphasis on modularity and type hinting.
    *   `Tic_tac_toe_enhanced.py`:  A more structured implementation with extensive use of type hints and docstrings for better readability and maintainability.

*   **Code Style:**
    *   The enhanced version adopts a more modern Python coding style, utilizing type hints and detailed docstrings throughout the code.
    *   The basic version provides a functional game but lacks the advanced code enhancements found in the enhanced version.
